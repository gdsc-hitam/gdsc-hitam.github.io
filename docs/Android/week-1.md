In the first session we got ourselves familiarized with the installation of the android studio and the developer UI.

In this following article you will learn about how to install android studio on you PC.

Setting up Android Studio takes just a few clicks.

First, be sure you download the [latest version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).


## Windows
To install Android Studio on Windows, proceed as follows:

1. If you downloaded an .exe file (recommended), double-click to launch it. 

If you downloaded a .zip file, unpack the ZIP, copy the android-studio folder into your Program Files folder, and then open the android-studio > bin folder and launch studio64.exe (for 64-bit machines) or studio.exe (for 32-bit machines).

2. Follow the setup wizard in Android Studio and install any SDK packages that it recommends.

     

That's it. The following [video](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/videos/studio-install-windows.mp4) shows each step of the setup procedure when using the recommended .exe download.


## Mac

To install Android Studio on your Mac, proceed as follows:

1. Launch the Android Studio DMG file.
2. Drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder, then launch Android Studio.

3. Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings, then click **OK**.
4. The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development.

That's it. The following [video](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/videos/studio-install-mac.mp4) shows each step of the recommended setup procedure.
