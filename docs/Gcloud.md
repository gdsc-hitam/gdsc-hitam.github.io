## Why Google Cloud Platform?

Now that you have a brief idea of What is Google Cloud Platform and Cloud Computing, let’s understand why one must go for it. Google Cloud Platform, is a suite of cloud computing services that run on the **same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products**, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Photos and YouTube. We all know how big is the database of Gmail, Youtube and Google Search.

And I don’t think in the recent years, Google’s server has gone down. It’s one of the biggest in the world, so it seems an obvious choice, to trust them, Right?

So now look at some of the features of GCP what really gives it an upper hand over other vendors.
